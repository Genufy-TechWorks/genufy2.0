                      In Salesforce environment with every release, the list of
                      Lightning-exclusive features grows larger. Lightning
                      Experience is the future of Salesforce enhancements.
                      Organizations that are not adopting Lightning are falling
                      behind and missing out on the innovations, user-
                      friendliness, and collaboration that allow Lightning users
                      to connect with their prospects and customers on a
                      strategic level, resulting in better customer
                      relationships.
